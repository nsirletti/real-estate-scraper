Overview
========

A personnal project based off my Master's reasearch using Scrapy (https://scrapy.org) to retrieve data from real-estate websites.
I started rebuilding this from Scrapy's project builder script in may 2020 and this is not yet functional.

Requirements
============

* Python 3.7.5
* Scrapy 2.1.0
